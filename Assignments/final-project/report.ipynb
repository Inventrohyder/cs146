    "In spite of the fluctuations, current levels of atmospheric carbon are unprecedented. The recent increase in carbon levels may be attributed to human activities especially after the industrial age. Given that the Earth has never experienced such levels before, nature might not have adapted to such levels. Could the recent mass extinction of species be linked to increasing levels of carbon? We will not be looking into the causality or effects of increasing carbon levels; however, they may be very interesting. Here we are going to develop a model that would help us forecast future levels of atmospheric carbon given data from the past several years. Such a model would help us identify if we deviate from the general trend predicted positively or negatively. It also helps us identify, when CO$_2$ levels would likely reach dangerous levels such as 450 ppm."
