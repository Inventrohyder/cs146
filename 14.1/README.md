### Task 1

1. The Rhat value is about 1, that means that the stan model was able to do a good sampling. The markov chains mixed well.

2. The total number of samples were 2000*4 - 1000*4 = 4000. The effective number of samples are about 1000 or 1400. In comparison to the number of iterations 1000(*4) which is actually really good.
